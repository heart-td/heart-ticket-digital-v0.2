<hr>
<h2 id="6-third-party-links">6. Third-Party Links</h2>
<p>This site may contain links to third-party websites or services.

<hr>
<h2 id="7-offerings-and-refund-policy">7. Offerings and Refund Policy</h2>
<p>Our Refund Policy forms an integral part of these Terms and is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to review our <a href="/refund-policy/">Refund Policy</a>, available separately, which provides additional detail and procedural guidance for requesting a refund, where applicable.</p>
<p><strong>We uphold a strict no-refund policy for all digital products.</strong></p>
<p>This is due to the nature of digital products: once made available to you, either through access or download, the product is considered to have been seen by you and thus consumed, and so it cannot be returned in any meaningful way. As such, refunds will not be granted simply due to a change of mind or dissatisfaction after access.</p>
<p>We may, however, on a product-by-product basis, vary our refund rules or offer satisfaction guarantees that differ from our standard site-wide policy. In such cases, the specific product refund or guarantee terms will take precedence over the general policy stated here. These guarantees, when offered, will be clearly outlined on the relevant product page or communication at the time of sale.</p>
<p>Exceptions to our general <a href="/refund-policy/">Refund Policy</a> will only be considered under the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Duplicate transactions (accidental repeat purchases)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Inability to access the product due to a technical error on our part</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each request will be reviewed with care and fairness. This policy ensures the integrity of our offerings while protecting the rights of our creators and contributors. </p>
<p>Detailed terms of sale and refund, including any product-specific guarantees or exceptions, will be made available at the time of purchase for each offering. Where no such terms are made available, the general refund conditions outlined in this section shall apply in conjunction with our Refund Policy. In the event of any inconsistency, the provisions in this Terms of Service shall take precedence.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="8-limitation-of-liability">8. Limitation of Liability</h2>

We are under no obligation to accept ownership of any submitted content, even if an intent to assign it is declared. We reserve the right to reject any submission at our sole discretion. Rejection does not imply acceptance, nor does it create any liability or obligation on our part, and accepted content may still be subject to review or removal under our discretion.</p>
<p>However, by submitting such content, you grant Heart Ticket Digital a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license — including the right to sublicense for operational and promotional purposes — to use, reproduce, publish, adapt, display, distribute, and create derivative works from the content in any medium now known or later developed, for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined herein, including archival, promotional, and operational use.

<p>This license is subject to applicable data protection laws. Where submitted content includes personal data, you may request its removal, correction, or anonymization, and we will honor such requests in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA). We may continue to use anonymized or non-personally identifiable content — such as general testimonials — even if the associated personal data is withdrawn. In such cases, we may attribute content generically (e.g., &quot;a former user&quot;) without compromising your privacy.</p>
<p>This license includes use for purposes such as, but not limited to: promotional materials, editorial content, platform development, research, product improvement, user experience optimization, and archival documentation.</p>
<p>By submitting any content to this site, you declare that you are solely responsible for any content you submit, and you represent, warrant, and affirm that your submissions are made in good faith and do not violate any applicable law or third-party rights, including but not limited to intellectual property, privacy, or moral rights.</p>
<p><strong>Retention and Rights Requests:</strong><br>Unless otherwise stated, we may retain submitted content for as long as necessary to support our editorial, promotional or archival purposes, consistent with the license granted. If you wish to request deletion, correction, or review of personal data associated with content you have submitted to us, you may do so by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@heartticket.digital" target="_blank">privacy@heartticket.digital</a>. We will respond to such requests in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA) and our internal review policies. Please note that while we honor requests to remove personally identifiable information, we may retain anonymized or non-personal elements of submitted content under the license granted above. We are under no obligation to retract the license for non-personal content, but where reasonable and in good faith, we will consider full retraction requests.</p>
<p><strong>Security Measures:</strong><br>While we cannot guarantee complete protection of all user-submitted content (especially where published publicly or used in promotions), we take reasonable steps to safeguard submitted materials from unauthorized alteration or misuse in our internal systems.</p>
<p>We value respectful and intentional interactions with our users. If you submit content to us in good faith and later have concerns about how it may be used, we encourage you to contact us. While we are under no obligation to retract any rights granted to us by you in submitting your content to us, we are committed to handling such requests with fairness and humanity, in line with the spirit of trust that Heart Ticket Digital seeks to uphold. To that end, sublicensing rights shall be exercised in good faith and only for purposes consistent with the operation, promotion, or improvement of Heart Ticket Digital and its services, and we will not sell or commercially exploit your content through sublicensing to unrelated third parties.</p>
