      <!-- Insert your full Refund Policy document below this line -->
<h1 id="refund-policy">Refund Policy</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: 8 May 2025</em></p>
<p>This Refund Policy applies to all digital products sold by Heart Ticket Digital, Business Registration No. 202503109056 (003721915-P), registered in Malaysia.</p>
<p>By purchasing any digital product from Heart Ticket Digital, you agree to the terms of this Refund Policy.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-no-refund-policy-general-principle-">1. No Refund Policy (General Principle)</h2>
<p>Due to the nature of digital products, which are immediately accessible upon purchase, all sales are considered final. This is in line with international best practices for digital products and supported by applicable consumer protection laws. Once the product has been accessed or downloaded, it is deemed “used,” and therefore ineligible for return or refund.</p>
<p>Digital products, once seen, cannot be unseen or returned, and we must treat any access or download event as confirmation that the product has been delivered and seen. While we respect that individual circumstances may vary, our systems treat all access or download events as final. This ensures fairness and protects the integrity of our offerings.</p>
<p>We track delivery and access to our digital products through standard systems such as email logs, download confirmations, or browser-based delivery events. Once these systems indicate that a product has been accessed or downloaded, we consider it delivered and consumed for the purposes of this refund policy.</p>
<p>By completing your purchase, you acknowledge and agree that delivery of the digital product is immediate. Upon access or download, the product is considered fully delivered and consumed. This constitutes an express waiver of any cooling-off period or statutory right of withdrawal under Malaysian law, where applicable.</p>
<p>To complete your purchase, you will be required to tick an unchecked checkbox affirming that you have read, understood, and accepted this Refund Policy. This action will be logged alongside your purchase details as evidence of informed consent.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-exceptions-to-our-no-refund-policy">2. Exceptions to Our No Refund Policy</h2>
<p>While all sales are generally final, we may grant exceptions under the following clearly defined circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Duplicate Purchases</strong>: If you accidentally purchase the same digital product more than once.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Non-Delivery Due to Verified Technical Failure</strong>: If our systems fail to deliver your product and we are unable to resolve the issue within <strong>48 business hours</strong> from your support request. This excludes issues caused by third-party software, email spam filters, browser incompatibility, or user device limitations.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Corrupted or Defective Products</strong>: If the digital product is materially defective, unreadable, or functionally incomplete compared to the features explicitly described on the product page at the time of purchase. This does not include failure to access the product due to outdated software, unsupported file readers, insufficient device capabilities, or other technical limitations on the customer’s end. All products are tested for compatibility with standard, up-to-date PDF readers and mainstream operating systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All refund requests must include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your full name and the email address used during checkout</p>
</li>
<li><p>The product name and date of purchase</p>
</li>
<li><p>A brief description of the issue and any error messages encountered</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your invoice number or order ID (if available)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We may request additional supporting materials to evaluate your claim, including but not limited to: error screenshots, browser details, device type, and logs related to attempted access.</p>
<p>Refund requests must be submitted to support@heartticket.digital. We reserve the right to assess each request individually and determine eligibility based on the available evidence.</p>
<p>Please note: vague, incomplete, fraudulent, or unverifiable requests will not be considered.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-product-specific-guarantees-if-offered-">3. Product-Specific Guarantees (If Offered)</h2>
<p>In some cases, we may offer a satisfaction guarantee or alternate refund terms on a digital product-specific basis.</p>
<p>Where such terms exist, they will be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clearly and explicitly stated on the <strong>product's official sales page</strong>, checkout interface, or in the purchase confirmation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Applicable only to the specific product for which they are offered</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enforced according to the terms described, which may include conditions such as refund deadlines, proof of action taken, or satisfaction criteria</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a product-specific guarantee applies, it will override the standard site-wide refund policy for that product alone. All other products remain subject to the general refund rules outlined above.</p>
<p>If you believe you are eligible for a product-specific guarantee, please refer to the product page and include a copy or screenshot of the stated terms when submitting your refund request.</p>
<p>In the event of a dispute, we will honor the terms as clearly stated at the time of purchase. Customers are encouraged to retain a copy or screenshot of any product-specific guarantee displayed at checkout.</p>
<p>Where a satisfaction guarantee is offered, the specific terms and conditions will define the criteria for eligibility (e.g., completion of certain steps, usage timelines, or documented feedback).</p>
<p>Guarantees are only valid when clearly stated on the product’s official sales page, checkout interface, or accompanying email confirmation. General marketing language does not constitute a guarantee unless explicitly restated at the point of sale.</p>
<p>In the event of any inconsistency between this Refund Policy and our <a href="/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>, the provisions stated in the <a href="/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a> shall take precedence.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-review-and-resolution">4. Review and Resolution</h2>
<p>Refund requests, when submitted with full documentation, will be reviewed within <strong>7 business days</strong>. Approved exceptions will be processed promptly using the original payment method whenever possible.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-changes-to-this-policy">5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to update or amend this Refund Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this page and take effect immediately upon publication. Continued purchases from our platform constitute acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
<p>This Refund Policy shall be governed by the laws of Malaysia. Any disputes arising from this policy shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Malaysian courts.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-chargebacks-and-dispute-policy">6. Chargebacks and Dispute Policy</h2>
<p>By purchasing from Heart Ticket Digital, you agree to contact us first and attempt to resolve any issue before initiating a chargeback with your payment provider. Unwarranted chargebacks for fulfilled digital products may be contested and could result in the restriction of future purchases from our platform.</p>
